# Genome-wide Discovery of DEAD-box RNA Helicase Targets Reveals RNA Structural Remodeling in Transcription Termination

## Workflow for iCLIP
1. Removing Solexa adaptors using Trimmomatic (v. 0.36)
2. De-mutiplexing reads (use the script here: https://github.com/qczhang/icSHAPE/blob/master/scripts/splitFastq.pl)
3. Removing PCR duplicates based on built-in random barcodes (use the script here: https://github.com/qczhang/icSHAPE/blob/master/scripts/readCollapse.pl)
